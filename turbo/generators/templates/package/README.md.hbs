# @repo/{{ slug name }}

A shared package that can be used from other apps / packages.

To add it as as a dependency in another package, run:

```sh
cd apps/example-worker-echoback # or whatever app/package you want to add it to
pnpm add '@repo/{{ slug name }}@workspace:*'
```

## Updating tsconfig.json

By default, packages use this tsconfig.json:

```json
{
	"extends": "@repo/typescript-config/workers-lib.json"
}
```

If this package is not used within Workers, change it to:

```json
{
	"extends": "@repo/typescript-config/lib.json"
}
```
